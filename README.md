My name is CÃ©dric CHAUVET

This is the repo of my spe at Holberton.

I started my training in march 2024

i am studying maching learning, in this repo  you will find project divided in task. those tasks are essencially writen in Python

## Getting Started
To get started with these projects, clone the repository and navigate to the desired project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CedricChauvet/holbertonschool-machine_learning.git
cd holbertonschool-machine_learning
```


You will find several projects:

## Projects Overview
