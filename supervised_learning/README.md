This is the supervised learning repo



  - classifcation
  - decision tree
  - error analysys
  - keras
  - optimization
  - regularization
  - tensoflow

I essancially used numpy, the tasks helped me to handle concept like
error analysis, optimization and regularization.
then tensoflow and keras are much higher level. 

the difficulty was in decision tree project with functional programming and binary tree
